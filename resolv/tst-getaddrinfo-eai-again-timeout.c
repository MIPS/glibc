/* Test for BZ #16849. Verify that getaddrinfo correctly returns
   EAI_AGAIN when DNS resolution fails due to timeout or malformed
   responses.

   This test uses two simulated failure modes:
   - The DNS server does not respond at all (resolv_response_drop).
   - The DNS server responds with a zero-length packet.
