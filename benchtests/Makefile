# Makefile for benchmark tests.  The only useful target here is `bench`.

# Adding a new function `foo`:
# ---------------------------

# - Append the function name to the bench variable

# - Define foo-ITER with the number of iterations you want to run

# - Define foo-ARGLIST as a colon separated list of types of the input
#   arguments.  Use `void` if function does not take any inputs.  Put in quotes
#   if the input argument is a pointer, e.g.:

#      malloc-ARGLIST: "void *"

# - Define foo-RET as the type the function returns.  Skip if the function
#   returns void.  One could even skip foo-ARGLIST if the function does not
#   take any inputs AND the function returns void.


# - Make a file called `foo-inputs` with one input value per line, an input
#   being a comma separated list of arguments to be passed into the function.
#   See pow-inputs for an example.
